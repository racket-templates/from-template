# from-template 

This package `from-template` allows users to quickly set up a working template for a variety of Racket projects.
It works by adding a new `raco` command `from-template` that downloads a repo from 
[github.com/racket-templates](https://github.com/racket-templates) and removing the git history 
from the project so you get a fresh start.

# Install

1. [Set your PATH environment variable](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Set-your-PATH-environment-variable) 
so you can use `raco` and other Racket command line functions.
2. either look for `from-template` in the DrRacket menu **File|Package Manager**, or run the `raco` command:
```bash
raco pkg install from-template
```

# Usage 
```bash
raco from-template <template-name> <destination-dir>
```
